# Support Desk

An omnichannel customer support and ticketing system that centralizes customer conversations, support requests, attachments, and ticket records in one structured workflow.

This project combines a TypeScript backend, React frontend, Supabase/PostgreSQL database, n8n workflow automation, OpenPhone, Gmail, Google Drive, and AI-assisted email triage.

---

## Overview

Support Desk is designed to collect customer communications from multiple channels such as phone calls, SMS/MMS, email, and website forms.

Instead of leaving support data scattered across different tools, the system normalizes incoming communication data, matches or creates customer records, stores interaction history, and creates tickets when follow-up is needed.

The project includes both the application layer and the automation layer:

- **Backend API** for authentication, tickets, customers, records, search, dashboard data, attachments, and actions
- **Frontend dashboard** for viewing and managing support operations
- **n8n workflows** for ingesting external communication events and storing structured records
- **Supabase/PostgreSQL schema** for customer, ticket, communication, and attachment data

---

## What This Project Solves

Customer support data often gets fragmented across different tools:

- Phone calls stay inside phone systems
- SMS and MMS messages are separate from emails
- Website form submissions are not connected to customer history
- Attachments and recordings can take up server storage
- Support requests are hard to track without a ticket system
- Staff need a single place to search customers, tickets, and communication records

This project solves that by creating a structured support pipeline:

Data normalization and deduplication

## Architecture

The system is designed around four core database entities:

### Customers

Stores customer identity and contact information.

Typical fields:

- Full name
- Primary and secondary email
- Primary and secondary phone
- Normalized phone numbers
- Notes
- Source

### Tickets

Stores support cases that require follow-up.

Typical fields:

- Ticket number
- Customer ID
- Title and description
- Category
- Priority
- Status
- Source
- Last activity time

### Communications

Stores every interaction with a customer, whether or not it creates a ticket.

Examples:

- Phone call
- SMS
- MMS
- Email
- Website form submission
- Voicemail
- Future outbound replies

### Attachments

Stores metadata for files related to communications and tickets.

Files are uploaded to Google Drive. Supabase stores metadata such as:

- File name
- MIME type
- File size
- Drive view URL
- Communication ID
- Ticket ID
- Customer ID

## Backend Modules

The backend is organized into route-based modules:

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `auth.routes.ts` | Login and authentication flow |
| `tickets.routes.ts` | Ticket list, detail, and updates |
| `customers.routes.ts` | Customer list and customer detail data |
| `communications.routes.ts` | Communication records connected to customers and tickets |
| `records.routes.ts` | Unified communication record views |
| `dashboard.routes.ts` | Dashboard metrics and summary data |
| `attachments.routes.ts` | Attachment metadata and file references |
| `actions.routes.ts` | Operational actions such as replies or status changes |
| `search.routes.ts` | Global search across support data |
| `users.routes.ts` | Internal user/admin management |

---

## Frontend Pages

The frontend includes a dashboard-style support interface:

| Page | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LoginPage.tsx` | Admin login screen |
| `DashboardPage.tsx` | Support overview and metrics |
| `TicketsPage.tsx` | Ticket inbox/list view |
| `CustomersPage.tsx` | Customer list |
| `CustomerDetailPage.tsx` | Customer profile and history |
| `EmailRecordsPage.tsx` | Email communication records |
| `OpenPhoneRecordsPage.tsx` | Call/SMS-related records |
| `RecordDetailPage.tsx` | Detailed communication record view |
| `AttachmentsPage.tsx` | Uploaded attachment records |
| `SearchPage.tsx` | Global search page |
| `UsersPage.tsx` | Internal users/admin page |

---

## Environment Variables

The repository includes example environment files for both the root/backend configuration.

The backend environment configuration covers:

- Supabase URL and service role key
- JWT secret and token expiration
- Initial admin user setup
- Admin password reset configuration
- OpenPhone API access
- SMTP email sending
- CORS origins

Never commit real API keys, service role keys, webhook secrets, SMTP passwords, or production credentials.

---

## Security Principles

This project follows these security rules:

- Credentials are not committed to the repository
- API keys must be configured through environment variables or platform credentials
- n8n workflow exports should be sanitized before publication
- Google Drive folder IDs should be replaced with placeholders when needed
- Production webhook URLs should be reviewed before public release
- Supabase service role keys should only be used on trusted backend or automation environments
- Authentication-protected routes should go through JWT middleware

---

## Current Status

Completed:

- Backend project structure
- Express.js + TypeScript setup
- Supabase backend configuration
- Authentication middleware
